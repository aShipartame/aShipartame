HiðŸ‘‹! I am currently an M.S. student at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Guiming Luo](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculty/guimingluo.htm). I received my B.E. degree from Dalian University of Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Xinchen Ye](http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/yexinchen/en/index.htm).

I am interested in developing technologies that allow rapid establishment of models with lower data requirements.
Currently, my research focuses on metric-based few-shot learning, from differences between various training paradigms and how to unlock the full potential of local representations.
Additionally, I am particularly intrigued by the ability and prospects of meta-learning based on parameter generation for handling complex task spaces.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
